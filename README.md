The purpose of this project is to create a professional platform for the artist, Brig, to sell his prints.


Features(Coming Soon)

* Automated product updates using the Stripe API that change the image and prices based off of changes in the NocoDB database

* Webhook to trigger the check to see if there are products that need updating when someone uses the API
